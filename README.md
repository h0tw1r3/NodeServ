# NodeServ

This project is in early stages of development. If you are interested in getting involved please send me a message here on Github.

NodeServ aims to be a full-featured yet efficient, lightweight and performant web server. The Lighttpd of Node-land. NodeServ is not intended to be middleware, or a library, it aims to ne a free-standing application to serve http requests on a public facing server.

## Planned Features

* All the usual basics you'd expect from a web server: Directory indexes, Directory listings, Error handling, Access log reporting
* Highly configurable via flexible yet powerful syntax (YAML?)
* CGI/FCGI support
* Plugin API
